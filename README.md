# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts house prices in Bengaluru using property features such as location, total square feet, number of bathrooms, and BHK. The project covers data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and deployment.

🚀 Project Highlights:
End-to-end ML pipeline (data → model → deployment),
Advanced feature engineering (BHK extraction, sqft conversion, outlier removal),
Log-transformed target for better regression performance,
Multiple models compared (Linear, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest),
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV,
Residual analysis for model diagnostics,
Deployed using Streamlit for interactive predictions,
